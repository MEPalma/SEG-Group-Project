LIBRARIES:
MAP THE LIBRARIES TO YOUR IDE

WRITE A GIT IGNORE FOR ALL OF THE FILES FOR YOUR IDE, I HAVE ADDED SOME, BUT YOU MUST 
MAKE CHANGES BEFORE YOU COMMIT!

To use git_comm_push.sh:
./git_comm_push.sh "commit comment" 
this will add all of the files (gitignore!), commit with the comment, push to the repository, and log


Before starting we do git pull!
